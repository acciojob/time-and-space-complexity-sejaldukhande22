	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a way to represent how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size. An algorithm with better time complexity is considered more efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, storing an array of elements takes O(n) space.
